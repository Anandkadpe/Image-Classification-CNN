## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying German traffic signs. The model is built using a CNN architecture, trained on a dataset containing images of various traffic sign categories. This project could be used as part of a larger autonomous driving or driver assistance system.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). This dataset contains images of traffic signs with their respective categories, including:

Speed Limits
* No Entry
* Pedestrian Crossing
* Yield Signs
* and more...
